<p>A telephone, or phone, is a <strong>telecommunications device</strong> that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation
when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice,
into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone
which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.</p>
